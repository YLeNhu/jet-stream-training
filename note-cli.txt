limit 
--> nats.MaxAckPending(20)
Without MaxAckPending(20): The server will keep delivering messages even 
if the consumer is slow to acknowledge them. This can lead to a large number of in-flight unacknowledged messages.

--> with MaxAckPending(20) default 65,536
The server will stop delivering new messages when the consumer reaches 20 unacknowledged messages, effectively applying backpressure 
until the consumer processes and acknowledges some of the messages.

Ack Wait: 30s
If a message is not acknowledged within 30 seconds, 
it becomes eligible for redelivery. 
This is the time the consumer has to process and acknowledge the message 
before JetStream considers it unacknowledged and potentially redelivers it.
