    2.1. Streams
    2.2. Consumer 
        2.2.1 Push Consumer: Messages are pushed to the subscriber immediately as they are stored.
        2.2.2 Pull Consumer: The consumer requests (pulls) messages when it's ready to process them.
        2.2.3 Acknowledgment: Consumers can acknowledge the receipt of messages to ensure at-least-once or exactly-once delivery.
          2.2.3.1 Manual Ack: Explicit acknowledgment of each message
          2.2.3.2 Auto Ack: Messages are automatically acknowledged
    3. Message Durability
        3.1 store message 
            + Sequence number: Start from a specific message.
            + Time: Start from messages received at a certain time.
            + From the start: Replay all stored messages.
    4. Acknowledge Mechanisms (cơ chế ack)
        + At-Least-Once: Messages might be redelivered if not acknowledged. (message sẽ dc gửi lại nếu ko dc ack)
        + Exactly-Once: JetStream guarantees that each message is processed exactly once.
    5. Storage Types
        + Memory Storage: Fast but non-persistent. Messages are stored in memory.
        + File Storage: Persistent and durable, with messages stored on disk.
    6. Stream Retention Policies (policy config keep message in stream)
        + Max Messages: Limits the total number of messages in the stream.
        + Max Bytes: Limits the total size of the messages in the stream.
        + Max Age: Limits how long messages are kept (time-based retention).
    7. Replication and Fault Tolerance
        + JetStream can replicate data across multiple nodes to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
        + Streams can be replicated to multiple servers in a NATS cluster, allowing you to recover from failures without losing data.
    8. Subjects and Filtering
        + Subjects: In NATS/JetStream, messages are published to subjects, and streams are configured to listen to certain subjects or wildcards.
        +  Consumers can filter messages based on subjects or metadata to receive only relevant messages.
